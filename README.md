# Two Star Fix

## Summary

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to perform a celestial navigation two-star fix with no need for an assumed (dead reckoning) position.

## Introduction

When I heard about the idea of figuring out your location on the surface of the earth based on observations of celestial bodies it caught my attention. When I realized my current knowledge should be enough to do that I couldn't wait another second before writing some code to see if it would work.

Celestial navigation didn't start in modern days when we have portable, fast and precise calculators, it started around the 1800's, so navigators had to rely on a lot of tables and pen and paper maths. I was no where near interested on diving deep into complicated math developed to deal with the absence of a device we have everywhere.
